I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), expecting to graduate in 2026. In 2023, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from BUPT with a major in Internet of Things Engineering, and was also awarded a First-Class Honours degree from Queen Mary University of London.
