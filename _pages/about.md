## About Me

I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), expecting to graduate in 2026. In 2023, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree from BUPT with a major in Internet of Things Engineering, and was also awarded a First-Class Honours degree from Queen Mary University of London.

I am currently seeking **PhD candidate positions** in CS or interdisciplinary fields involving CS for **Fall 2026 or Spring 2027**. 

I have a solid research foundation in areas such as multimodal machine learning, test-time augmentation, and visual understanding. I am proficient in deep learning frameworks and have the ability to quickly reproduce projects for experimental purposes. Additionally, I possess strong teamwork skills, a sense of initiative, and self-motivation.
